# Shift cipher example

This is a small homework assignment for my HIC class.

## Encrypt Usage:
``` 
python encrypt.py <text>
```

The cipher text is hard-coded to shift letters by 3 positions.

> [!NOTE]
> If text contains spaces, enclose text with quotation marks: ```" "```

## Decrypt Usage:
``` 
python bruteforce.py <text>
```
